   <p> 
    I am grateful for the opportunity to study and have access to all the resources I need. I know that I am one of the lucky ones, and I do not take my education for granted. I am committed to making the most of my opportunities and using my education to make a positive impact on the world.

    I am aware that there are many people in the world who do not have the same opportunities as I do. I am grateful for the sacrifices that my parents and others have made to allow me to pursue my education. I am also grateful for the teachers and mentors who have helped me along the way.
    
    
    I know that education is the key to a better future. I am committed to using my education to help others and make the world a better place.
